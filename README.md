# target_ripper
An archive extractor tool for the Polish Windows game Target (1998).


## Usage
Place the executable inside the game's "data" subfolder (the one with the .RPL files), then launch it; everything else is pretty straightforward.
Once the extractor has done its thing, you should have the extracted resources in a subfolder named "Target rip",
located inside the same "data" subfolder.

## Extracted material
- Textures
- Sprites
- Various graphics (fonts, menus, HUDs, etc)
- Sounds

All picture-related material is extracted as .TGA pictures, which can be viewed fine with
IrfanView (albeit without transparency), SLADE3, MtPaint, and possibly other image viewers I'm unaware of;
if that's still a problem for you, Ken Silverman's PNGOUT is your friend :)
